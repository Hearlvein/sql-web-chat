# sql-web-chat
simple web chat using Ajax, PHP and MySQL

This is a very simple project. This was an occasion for me to practice web development using various technologies.
Technologies used:
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript (JQuery, Ajax: Asynchronous JavaScript HTTP Request)
  - PHP (called via XMLHTTPRequest)
  - SQL (easy reading-writing in unique table `messages` from database `chat`)
  
Enjoy!
